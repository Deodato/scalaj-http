 Simple http request library. Makes it easy to issue an http request and get a result.
 
 ==Overview==
 The main entry point is the [[scalaj.http.Http]] singleton. Calling Http(url) will return
 an instance of [[scalaj.http.HttpRequest]] which you can use to build up your request.
 Execute the request by calling one of the asXXX methods and get a [[scalaj.http.HttpResponse]] which will contain
 the responseCode, body and response headers.

 ==Usage Example==
 {{{
 > import scalaj.http._
 > val baseRequest: HttpRequest = Http("http://httpbin.org/post") // that's a get request by default
 baseRequest: scalaj.http.HttpRequest = HttpRequest(http://httpbin.org/post,GET, ...

 > val postRequest: HttpRequst = baseRequest.postForm.param("param1", "a").param("param2", "b") // create a post request
 postRequest: scalaj.http.HttpRequest = HttpRequest(http://httpbin.org/post,POST, ...
 
 > val response: HttpResponse[String] = postRequest.asString // execute the request
 response: scalaj.http.HttpResponse[String] =  HttpResponse(body...,200,Map(Access-Control-Allow-Origin -> *, ...))
 }}}
